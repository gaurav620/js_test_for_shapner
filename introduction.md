# Self Introduction (40-50 Seconds)

**"Tell me about yourself"**

"Hi, I am **Gaurav Kumar Mehta**, a final-year Computer Science student at **JIS College of Engineering**, with a strong passion for full-stack development and problem-solving.

I have honed my skills in the **MERN stack**, proficiently using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. My technical foundation is further solidified by a strong grasp of **Data Structures and Algorithms** in Java and Python.

I have built impactful projects like **FashionHub**, a responsive e-commerce platform that improved user buying efficiency by 35%, and a **Bike & Scooter Rental System** that features real-time tracking and secure payments.

Beyond development, I am proud to hold a **patent** for an AI-driven tumor detection system. I am now looking for an opportunity where I can apply my skills to build scalable enterprise solutions and grow as a software engineer. Thank you."
