# HR & Behavioral Questions (Updated for Sharpener + Company Interviews)

---

## Category 1: Self-Awareness

### Q1: Tell me about yourself

*(See introduction.md for the 40-50 sec script)*

### Q2: What are your strengths?

**Answer**:
"My top strength is **persistence in problem-solving**. When I encountered a double-booking race condition in my Bike Rental app, I didn't use a quick hack — I spent two days researching atomic database operations and implemented `findOneAndUpdate` properly. I believe in doing things the right way."

### Q3: What is your weakness?

**Answer**:
"I tend to **over-engineer** solutions initially. For example, in FashionHub, I built a complex caching system before even having enough users to need it. I've learned to follow the **YAGNI** principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It) — build for today, architect for tomorrow."

## Category 2: Motivation & Goals

### Q4: Why should we hire you?

**Answer**:
"Three reasons:

1. I **ship working products** — both FashionHub and Bike Rental are deployed and functional, not just GitHub repos.
2. I have a **patent** — proving I can innovate beyond coursework.
3. I'm a **fast learner** — I went from basic HTML to full-stack MERN with authentication, payments, and real-time features in under a year."

### Q5: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

**Answer**:
"I see myself as a **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** leading a small team, architecting scalable systems, and mentoring junior developers. I also want to explore **AI-powered web applications**, combining my web development skills with my ML background."

### Q6: Why do you want this job/role?

**Answer**:
"I want to work in a company where I can apply my full-stack skills to **real-world products** used by real users. I'm looking for a place that values learning and growth, where I can contribute from day one while continuously improving my craft."

## Category 3: Behavioral (STAR Method)

### Q7: Tell me about a time you handled pressure

**Answer**:

- **S**: Final semester — project submission, patent filing, and IBM SkillsBuild certification all due in the same month.
- **T**: I needed to deliver all three without compromising quality.
- **A**: Created a priority matrix, dedicated mornings to the project, afternoons to patent documentation, and evenings to certification. Communicated clearly with my team about deadlines.
- **R**: All three delivered on time — project graded A, patent published, and certification earned.

### Q8: Describe a time you worked in a team

**Answer**:

- **S**: Bike Rental project, 3-member team.
- **T**: Deliver MVP in 4 weeks.
- **A**: I took the backend (API + database), assigned frontend to one member, and testing to another. We did daily 15-min standups.
- **R**: MVP delivered on time, selected for department tech showcase. The clear role division was key.

### Q9: Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned

**Answer**:
"In my first project, I tried to build everything without Git version control. A bad code change broke my entire app and I had no way to revert. I lost 2 days of work. Since then, I **commit frequently** with meaningful messages, use branches for features, and never work directly on `main`. It taught me that good habits save more time than they cost."

## Category 4: Situational

### Q10: Can you handle relocation?

**Answer**: "Yes, I'm fully open to relocation anywhere in India for the right opportunity."

### Q11: What is your expected salary?

**Answer**: "As a fresher, I'm focused on **learning and growth**. I'm looking in the range of ₹4-6 LPA, but I'm flexible based on the role and company."

### Q12: Do you have any questions for us?

**Answer** *(Always ask at least 1!)*:

- "What does the first 3 months look like for a new hire?"
- "What tech stack does the team primarily use?"
- "How is the feedback and appraisal cycle structured?"
