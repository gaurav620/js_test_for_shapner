# HR & Behavioral Questions

### Q1: Why should we hire you?

**Answer**:
"I bring a blend of strong full-stack development skills (MERN) and a verified ability to innovative (my Patent). I don't just write code; I build solutions that impact users, as seen in the 35% efficiency boost in my FashionHub project. I am eager to learn, adaptable, and ready to contribute to your team immediately."

### Q2: What are your strengths and weaknesses?

**Answer**:

- **Strength**: "I am highly perseverant. When I faced the double-booking bug in my rental project, I didn't give up. I spent two days debugging until I understood database transactions thoroughly."
- **Weakness**: "I sometimes get too deep into the details of a feature, which can slow down initial prototyping. I am learning to prioritize 'MVP' (Minimum Viable Product) features first and iterate later."

### Q3: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

**Answer**:
"I see myself as a Senior Software Engineer or a Technical Lead, having mastered the architecture of scalable distributed systems. I want to be the person junior developers come to for guidance, just as I hope to learn from mentors here."

### Q4: Can you handle pressure?

**Answer**:
"Yes. During my final year project, we had a critical deadline coincide with my specific patent filing documentation. I prioritized tasks, created a strictly time-boxed schedule, and communicated clearly with my team. We delivered the project on time and I successfully filed the patent."
